# TypeScript Setup

## Description

This is a basic TypeScript setup that includes ESLint for static code analysis, Jest for testing, and Nodemon for development. The project consists of classes like `Audio`, `Episode`, and `Track`, along with testing examples.


## Project Structure

- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and follows best practices.
- **Jest**: Provides unit testing for the application.
- **Nodemon**: Automatically restarts the application during development.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jeka400/ts-setup.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ts-setup
    ```
   
3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```


## Scripts

- **`npm run build`**: Compiles the TypeScript files into JavaScript.
- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the application in development mode using Nodemon and compiles TypeScript files automatically.
- **`npm run test`**: Runs unit tests using Jest.
- **`npm run lint`**: Runs ESLint to analyze the code and ensure it follows best practices.
